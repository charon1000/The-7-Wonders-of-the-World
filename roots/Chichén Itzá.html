            <p>Chichén Itzá is a Mayan city on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, which flourished in the 9th and 10th
                centuries CE. Under the Mayan tribe Itzá—who were strongly influenced by the Toltecs—a number of
                important monuments and temples were built. Among the most notable is the stepped pyramid El Castillo
                (“The Castle”), which rises 79 feet (24 meters) above the Main Plaza. A testament to the Mayans’
                astronomical abilities, the structure features a total of 365 steps, the number of days in the solar
                year. During the spring and autumnal equinoxes, the setting sun casts shadows on the pyramid that give
                the appearance of a serpent slithering down the north stairway; at the base is a stone snake head. Life
                there was not all work and science, however. Chichén Itzá is home to the largest tlachtli (a type of
                sporting field) in the Americas. On that field the residents played a ritual ball game popular
                throughout pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.</p>
