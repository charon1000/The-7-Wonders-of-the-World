            <p>Christ the Redeemer, a colossal statue of Jesus, stands atop Mount Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro. Its
                origins date to just after World War I, when some Brazilians feared a “tide of godlessness.” They
                proposed a statue, which was ultimately designed by Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul
                Landowski. Construction began in 1926 and was completed five years later. The resulting monument stands
                98 feet (30 meters) tall—not including its base, which is about 26 feet (8 meters) high—and its
                outstretched arms span 92 feet (28 meters). It is the largest Art Deco sculpture in the world. Christ
                the Redeemer is made of reinforced concrete and is covered in approximately six million tiles. Somewhat
                disconcertingly, the statue has often been struck by lightning, and in 2014 the tip of Jesus’s right
                thumb was damaged during a storm.</p>
