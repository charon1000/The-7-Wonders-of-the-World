            <p>The Colosseum in Rome was built in the first century by order of the Emperor Vespasian. A feat of
                engineering, the amphitheater measures 620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 meters) and features a complex system
                of vaults. It was capable of holding 50,000 spectators, who watched a variety of events. Perhaps most
                notable were gladiator fights, though men battling animals was also common. In addition, water was
                sometimes pumped into the Colosseum for mock naval engagements. However, the belief that Christians were
                martyred there—namely, by being thrown to lions—is debated. According to some estimates, about 500,000
                people died in the Colosseum. Additionally, so many animals were captured and then killed there that
                certain species reportedly became extinct.</p>
